			<h3>High Quality</h3><p>The Mersey Critical Care Seminars were first launched in 2009 with the goal of providing knowledge that was both at the cutting edge and clinically relevant to Critical Care Practitioners in the North West.</p><br>
			</div>
			<div class="column">
            <h3>One Day</h3><p>The Seminars are conducted on an annual basis and held over the course of one day. Each year The Seminars focus on the fore-front and controversies of a specific field of Critical Care Medicine. With this focus in mind, the program is designed to deliver the optimum breadth and depth of topics in an efficient manner.</p> <br>
			</div>
		 	<div class="column">
				 <h3>5 CPD Points</h3><p>The Seminars are well established and have grown since their first inception. The Seminars are fortunate enought to attract both international and national speakers. The quality of education that The Seminars delivers has been recognised by the Royal College of Anaesthetists who have validated The Seminars for 5 External CPD points.</p>

        <div class="one-column-section-body"><p>Liverpool Medical Institution is one of the oldest medical societies in the world, tracing its origins back to the founding of the Liverpool Medical Library in 1779. For nearly two centuries this beautiful Grade II* Listed building has been a focus of medical life and a meeting place for the medical community of Merseyside, its primary role being that of a medical library. The Institution continues to serve the purposes for which it was founded, adapting itself to meet the various challenges of the times. The LMI is a Registered Charity and exists to foster an environment for furthering medical education and knowledge in the medical community and in the general public.</p></div>
